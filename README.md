## üîç Analysis and Insights

### **1. Salary Trends**
- The **mean** salary is higher than the **median**, indicating a **right-skewed distribution** with very high salaries inflating the average.
- A **high standard deviation** shows significant variation in salaries, especially for **senior (SE)** and **expert (EX)** roles.
- **Higher levels of experience correlate strongly with increased salaries**, as shown in the boxplot.

### **2. Remote Work and Salary**
- Jobs are primarily distributed across **0% (on-site)**, **50% (hybrid)**, and **100% (fully remote)** setups.
- The scatterplot analysis revealed **no strong correlation between remote work and salary**, indicating that remote work does not significantly affect compensation.

### **3. Experience Level and Salary**
- **Senior (SE)** and **Expert (EX)** levels are associated with both **higher salaries** and **greater salary dispersion**.
- The variation in high-experience salaries may reflect differences in job roles and responsibilities within the same category.
- **Experience level is the most influential factor** for salary determination.
